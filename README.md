# Magic Wrighter Invalid Character Assignment
repo for magic homework assignment

# How to run
This repo has two files InvalidCharacters.py and example.ach

Python 3.6 was used to create this script anything above this version should work for this script
https://www.python.org/downloads/

```
python InvalidCharacters.py
```

# Expected behavior:

After running the line above the script will prompt for a file path
```
Please enter path of .ach file:
```

if the example file is in the same directory you can just enter the file name

If you enter an invalid file path or a file that does not end with .ach you will be given an appropriate error (very basic error handline was done)

# Added notes:
I was not sure if spaces or new lines count so I added comments in the code regarding those two characters

There was not example .ach file so I made one and copied a line from this source to mimic a line of one at the end of the example.ach file I provided in this repo
